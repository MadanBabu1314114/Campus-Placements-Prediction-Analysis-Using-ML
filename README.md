 # Campus Placements Prediction Analysis Using ML

## Introduction

As part of our practical sessions in Python and R, our faculty provides us with diverse datasets to work on. This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of campus placements using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Context

The dataset encompasses placement data of students in a XYZ campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentages, specialization, degree specialization, type, work experience, and salary offers to the placed students.

## Acknowledgement

I extend my gratitude to Dr. Dhimant Ganatara, Professor at Jain University, for providing this valuable dataset. His support has been instrumental in enhancing our understanding of R programming through practical applications.
